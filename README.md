# My First Web Project - Login Form

Hi! I'm just starting my journey in web development, and this is my very first project.  
It's a simple **Login Form** built using only **HTML** and **CSS**.

Through this project, I practiced:

- Writing clean, semantic HTML
- Creating user input forms
- Applying basic styling with CSS
- Making the layout visually clean and responsive

I'm proud of this small step and excited to keep learning and building more!

Feel free to explore the code or share feedback ðŸ˜Š
